TrackSOM is a clustering and temporal cluster tracking algorithm specifically designed to cluster and track cluster changes in time-series of cytometry data.

TrackSOM was used to analyse COVID-19 temporal data published in Cell Reports Medicine journal:

Koutsakos, M., Rowntree, L.C., Hensen, L., Chua, B.Y., van de Sandt, C.E., Habel, J.R., Zhang, W., Jia, X., Kedzierski, L., Ashhurst, T.M. and Putri, G.H., 2021. Integrated immune dynamics define correlates of COVID-19 severity and antibody responses. Cell Reports Medicine, p.100208.

R scripts used to analyse the COVID-19 data are uploaded into covid19_paper directory.

We have yet to publish TrackSOM algorithm (stay tuned for it!). Thus, if you use TrackSOM in your publication, please cite this repository using the DOI next to the title.
