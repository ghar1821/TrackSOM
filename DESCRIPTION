Description: TrackSOM is a novel automated gating and phenotype-tracking 
    algorithm for cytometry data.
    It combines the excellent clustering capacity and fast run time of FlowSOM 
    with the tracking capability of ChronoClust, enabling it to map immune cell 
    population dynamics against time and/or disease severity status.
